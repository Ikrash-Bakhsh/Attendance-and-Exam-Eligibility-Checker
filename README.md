# Attendance-and-Exam-Eligibility-Checker
This C++ program takes the number of classes attended by a student, calculates the attendance percentage, and determines whether the student is eligible to sit in exams based on the attendance criteria. If the attendance is below the required percentage, the program checks if the student has a medical issue. If a medical issue is claimed, the student is prompted to submit medical reports; otherwise, the student is not allowed to sit in exams.
Note:
Make sure to enter a valid number of classes attended. If the attendance is below the required percentage, the program will prompt for a medical issue, and further instructions will be provided accordingly.
